Unzip the vstsdk2.4 files into here. There should be at least two directories in here once you've done that - `pluginterfaces` and `public.sdk`. You can probably get the vstsdk2.4.zip file [http://csound.1045644.n5.nabble.com/Steinberg-VST-headers-td3200892.html](from this post on the CSound mailing list) or the official VST SDK site.
