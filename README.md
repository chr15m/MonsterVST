Build VST .dlls on Linux, cross compiled for Windows.

Why would anyone want to do this? If you are running legacy Windows audio software such as Modplug Tracker under Wine on Linux, or in an old version of Windows, you might want to do this.

  * You will need the original VST SDK version 2.4 unzipped into the vstsdk2.4 directory.
  * You will need the `mingw32` package installed, for example with aptitude.
